# RealsimController


## About The Controller

The Unity Realsim controller was created to give full control of the player's movement, allowing players to move through environments seamlessly and realistically. The scripts currently allow for smooth speed transitioning, animation state management, movement state management, IK integration and more. Full feature list below. The character controller and camera controller scripts both work independently allowing for a no hassle integration into your current projects. Contributions are encouraged. Happy programming!
